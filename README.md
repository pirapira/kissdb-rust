kissdb-rust
===========

*Currently, it does not compile.  This is just my small toy for me to learn rust.*

[(Keep It) Simple and Stupid Database](https://github.com/zerotier/kissdb.git) ported to [rust](https://github.com/mozilla/rust).

Currently, put and get have been implemented.  Iterator methods to come.

To perform some tests:

    % git clone https://github.com/pirpaira/kissdb-rust
    % cd kissdb-rust
    % rustc --test ./kissdb-rust.rs # assuming master branch of rust
    % ./kissdb-rust
